# Intern_Tasks_at_GRIP_as_DataAnalyst
Tasks given in internship(GRIP) at The Sparks Foundation

##### Tasks and Description :

###### Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML
(Level - Beginner)

          ● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
          ● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
          ● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
          ● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
          ● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

###### Task - 6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)

          ● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
          ● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
